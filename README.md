<h1>Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning</h1>

Hi, in this repository, I have worked on Credit Card Spam Detection, a Machine Learning project.

Credit Card Fraud Detection: The challenge is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

Machine Learning concept used: Random Forest Classifier

The project dataset can be downloaded from the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The project is entirely compiled and run in Jupyter Notebook.
